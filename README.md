# API Wars

My task was to create a website where we can see a list of the planents from the Star Wars universe.
To achieve this I had to use [The Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/).
This project is available live at https://api-wars-jj.herokuapp.com.

Once you have registered and logged in you will presented with the first 10 planets.
Click the Next/Previous buttons to load other planets. Planets with Residents have a clickable button that opens a modal with the details of the residents. You can also click on the Vote button of your favourite planet. To see all the votes click the Voting Statistics on the top left and another modal will appear with the current chart.

I have learned and furthered my knowledge in the following topics:

- Create a Flask backend project
- Use routes with Flask
- Use Bootstrap
- Use simple queries in SQL
- Use AJAX for API requests
- Understand session handling
- Store passwords
- Deploy app to Heroku
